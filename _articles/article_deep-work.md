- Deep Work (intense, value-creating work, requires concentration) vs Shallow Work (distractive, easily replaceable with machines)
-- Deep Work is ultimately be capable of: a) focusing tightly on a specific matter, b) getting fast feedback to keep the focusing always productive
- The economy is "restructuring" from industrial to informational at a faster pace: to keep up on a successful way you need to be able to
1) Learn complex systems quickly
2) Produce elite-level work (Quality+speed)
Both depend on the ability to perform Deep Work.
- In the restructuring three groups of people will likely thrive: a) those who can work with intelligent machines ("deep thinkers"), b) those who are the very best at what they do ("superstars"), c) those who have access to capital ("owners")
- The current economy prefer Shallow Work over Deep Work because its advantages are too hard to measure (the "Metric Black Hole"): more distractive and less productive ways are prioritized because: 
-- 1) they are easier to implement (the "Path of least resistance"), 
-- 2) with no better metrics, information workers use industrial ones (e.g. amount of processed emails) to measure public  productivity, 
-- 3) deep work is not technological enough in the current technopoly
